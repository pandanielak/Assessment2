Algorithm 4: to print the top 5 students with the highest total marks and the top 5 students with the lowest total marks
1.	Create function TopAndBottomMarks.
2.	Create topMarks and bottomMarks empty lists.
3.	Iterate through each student in students
If size of list is lower than 5
Add student object to topMarks
Else
For i = 0 to size of topMarks -1
If student.getTotalMark() > topMarks[i].getTotalMark();
Insert student object at index I and remove object from index 5
4.	Iterate through each student in students
If size of list is lower than 5
Add student object to bottomMarks
Else
For i = 0 to size of topMarks -1
If student.getTotalMark() < bottomMarks[i].getTotalMark();
Insert student object at index I and remove object from index 5
5.	Print both lists with student name, id and total mark.
